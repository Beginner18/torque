.SH NAME
qdel \- Remote shutdown, reconfiguration, diagnostics, and querying of the pbs_mom daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
momctl [\-c {jobid|all}] [\-C] [\-d {integer|jobid}] [-f file] [\-H host [,host]...] [\-l] [-p port] [-q attrib] -r {file|LOCAL:file} [-s] [-u]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B momctl
command allows remote shutdown, reconfiguration, diagnostics, and querying of the pbs_mom daemon.
.NL
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-c {jobid|all}" 15
Make the MOM unaware of the job's existence. It does not clean up any processes associated with the job.
.IP "\-C" 15
Cycle pbs_mom (force the MOM to send a status update to pbs_server).
.NL
.IP "\-d {integer|jobid}" 15
Diagnose MOM(s). (For more details, see DIAGNOSE DETAIL below.)
.NL
.IP "\-f file" 15
A file containing only comma or whitespace (space, tab, or new line) delimited hostnames.
.NL
.IP "\-h host[,host]..." 15
A comma separated list of hosts.
.NL
.IP "\-l" 15
Display the layout of the machine as it is understood by Torque.
.NL
.IP "\-p port" 15
The port number for the specified MOM(s).
.NL
.IP "\-q attrib" 15
Query or set attrib, where attrib is a property listed by pbsnodes -a (see QUERY ATTRIBUTES below for a list of attributes). Can also be used to query or set pbs_mom options (see RESOURCES below).
.NL
.IP "\-r {file|LOCAL:file}" 15
Reconfigure MOM(s) with remote or local config file, file. This does not work if $remote_reconfig is not set to true when the MOM is started.
.NL
.IP "\-s" 15
Have the MOM shut itself down gracefully (this includes reporting to server so that pbsnodes marks the node down).
.NL
.IP "\-u"
Update the hardware configuration on pbs_server with a layout from the MOM.
.NL
.SH QUERY ATTRIBUTES
.IP "\fBarch\fP" 4
node hardware architecture
.IP "\fBavailmem\fP" 4
available RAM
.IP "\fBloadave\fP" 4
1 minute load average
.IP "\fBncpus\fP" 4
number of CPUs available on the system
.IP "\fBnetload\fP" 4
total number of bytes transferred over all network interfaces
.IP "\fBnsessions\fP" 4
number of sessions active
.IP "\fBnusers\fP" 4
number of users active
.IP "\fBphysmem\fP" 4
configured RAM
.IP "\fBsessions\fP" 4
list of active sessions
.IP "\fBtotmem\fP" 4
configured RAM plus configured swap
.NL
.SH RESOURCES
Resource Manager queries can be made with momctl -q options to retrieve and set pbs_mom options. Any configured static resource may be retrieved with a request of the same name. These are resource requests not otherwise documented in the PBS ERS.
.br
.IP "\fBcycle\fP" 4
Forces an immediate MOM cycle.
.IP "\fBstatus_update_time\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $status_update_time parameter.
.IP "\fBcheck_poll_time\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $check_poll_time parameter.
.IP "\fBconfigversion\fP" 4
Retrieve the config version.
.IP "\fBjobstartblocktime\fP" 4.IP "\fB
Retrieve or set the $jobstartblocktime parameter.
.IP "\fBenablemomrestart\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $enablemomrestart parameter.
.IP "\fBloglevel\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $loglevel parameter.
.IP "\fBdown_on_error\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $down_on_error parameter.
.IP "\fBdiag0 - diag4\fP" 4
Retrieves varied diagnostic information.
.IP "\fBrcpcmd\fP" 4
Retrieve or set the $rcpcmd parameter.
.IP "\fBversion\fP" 4
Retrieves the pbs_mom version.
.NL
.SH DIAGNOSE DETAIL
.IP "\fBLevel 0\fP" 4
